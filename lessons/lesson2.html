Now, how about some color? 
</p> 
<p>You can give <code>twinkle</code> some extra instructions.</p>

<p>Try this code out: <pre>twinkle (red: 255, green: 0, blue: 0) </pre> </p>

<p>What color do you see? Try changing those numbers to see what you get.</span> </p>

<p>You can mix three colors of light - red, green, and blue - to get all the shades in between. <code>red: 0</code> means the red light is all the way off. <code>red: 255</code> means it is all the way on. Numbers in between 0 and 255 mean it's part of the way on. </span> </p>
